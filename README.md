# Welcome to my first Project

## 1.To Do List

I used _ATOM_ the editor to write all my HTML & CSS code.

First i started to write my HTML code.

After that, i put some information on my HTML code to know where exactly i am.

When all the code was written, i started to write my CSS code by putting the different box outside my header, article, section and also the footer at the bottom of my page.

The Design of my page is very simple , i put a background image , now we can feel a working space, who anybody can write his own to do list.


## 2.Curriculum Vitae

I uses _ATOM_ the editor also to write all my HTML & CSS code.

I did the same structure as the first point.

The Design of my page is something very typical.
I put a background image of some friend and children when i was volunteer at Pondicherry in India.
